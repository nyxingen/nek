						<b>Design and creation of videogames [in English]</b>
					</h4>
					<h3 class="subtitle">
						The extracurricular video game design tries to bring students closer to their favorite
						games from another point of view, from the creation of their contents.
						Through knowledge of programming and digital art, children will be
						able to enjoy games made by themselves.
					</h3></br></br>
					<h1 class="title">
						Why?
					</h1>
					<h4 class="subtitle">
						Since 2017 the video game industry has twice the market value of all the artistic industries combined; this makes sense since video games touch almost all artistic areas; such as 3D modelling, illustration, music, video, writing; besides adding its own, interaction thanks to programming. This is why teaching video game creation and design becomes one of the most complete and fun extra schools that exist! That not only covers a huge diversity of artistic expression, but also the subjects of the STEM field (Science, Technology, Engineering, Math). By handling for example coordinates, angles, speed, time, gravity that are required to be created in the video game, they reinforce the knowledge of the school and learn to use them having fun programming since they will play those games that they themselves design. And for them, they will have to use all the creativity, logic and sequence of movements needed for the video games to work properly. Are you up for the challenge?
					</h4></br></br>
					<h1 class="title">
						How?
					</h1>
					<h4 class="subtitle">
						In the classes students will discover what elements compose a video game and how they can create them by themselves, enhancing their imagination, artistic qualities, logical thinking and teamwork.
					</br>
						The platforms and digital programming software will be the protagonists of the extracurricular video game design. Tools such as Scratch will allow the creation of the first video games more rudimentary, until reaching complex platforms that require an advanced level in programming.
