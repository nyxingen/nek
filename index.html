				<p><strong>Design and creation of videogames [in English]</strong></p>
				<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

				<!-- wp:paragraph -->
				<p>The extracurricular video game design tries to bring students closer to their favorite games from another point of view, from the creation of their contents. Through knowledge of programming and digital art, children will be able to enjoy games made by themselves.</p>
				<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

				<!-- wp:paragraph -->
				<p><strong>Why?</strong></p>
				<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

				<!-- wp:paragraph -->
				<p>Since 2017 the video game industry has twice the market value of all the artistic industries combined; this makes sense since video games touch almost all artistic areas; such as 3D modelling, illustration, music, video, writing; besides adding its own, interaction thanks to programming. This is why teaching video game creation and design becomes one of the most complete and fun extra schools that exist! That not only covers a huge diversity of artistic expression, but also the subjects of the STEM field (Science, Technology, Engineering, Math). By handling for example coordinates, angles, speed, time, gravity that are required to be created in the video game, they reinforce the knowledge of the school and learn to use them having fun programming since they will play those games that they themselves design. And for them, they will have to use all the creativity, logic and sequence of movements needed for the video games to work properly. Are you up for the challenge?</p>

				<!-- wp:paragraph -->
				<p><strong>How?</strong></p>
				<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

				<!-- wp:paragraph -->
				<p>In the classes students will discover what elements compose a video game and how they can create them by themselves, enhancing their imagination, artistic qualities, logical thinking and teamwork.</p>
				<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

				<!-- wp:paragraph -->
				<p>The platforms and digital programming software will be the protagonists of the extracurricular video game design. Tools such as Scratch will allow the creation of the first video games more rudimentary, until reaching complex platforms that require an advanced level in programming.</p>

				<p>Stages of video game development</p>
				<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

				<!-- wp:paragraph -->
				<p><strong>1. The first day begins!</strong></p>
				<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

				<!-- wp:paragraph -->
				<p>To begin we need to know you and the people you would like to work with as a team. On this day we will decide how to create the groups so that they are balanced according to the interests of each student and we will learn about the history of video games.</p>
				<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

				<!-- wp:paragraph -->
				<p><strong>2. Brainstorming</strong></p>
				<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

				<!-- wp:paragraph -->
				<p>This is where it all begins, you have the opportunity to propose mechanics, a story, a specific style and to start guiding your team through the vision of the video game that you will create together.</p>
				<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

				<!-- wp:paragraph -->
				<p><strong>3. Narrative</strong></p>
				<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

				<!-- wp:paragraph -->
				<p>A memorable story is the true core of a video game, it should motivate the player to advance to the next level and make an impact that makes them want more of the games you developed.</p>
				<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

				<!-- wp:paragraph -->
				<p><strong>4. Art</strong></p>
				<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

				<!-- wp:paragraph -->
				<p>From the main character, the secondary characters, villains, scenarios, textures, menus; you will always need to create the conceptual art of your video game to bring it to life.</p>
				<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

				<!-- wp:paragraph -->
				<p><strong>5. Graphics and audio</strong></p>
				<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

				<!-- wp:paragraph -->
				<p>Here you create the elements of the worlds, you take the conceptual art to the pixel art, 2D, 3D modelling, or even combining them; and you will learn how to find and generate memorable sounds: melodies, settings and effects that will become an indispensable part of your video game.</p>
				<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

				<!-- wp:paragraph -->
				<p><strong>6. Programming and use of the game engine</strong></p>
				<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

				<!-- wp:paragraph -->
				<p>Now it's time for the part of building the levels using programming! Create the checkpoints, structures, and join all the pieces previously created so that the Heroes and Villains of your video game can walk and jump...</p>
				<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

				<!-- wp:paragraph -->
				<p>And make your story come true!</p>
				<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

				<!-- wp:paragraph -->
				<p><strong>7. Launching and testing</strong></p>
				<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

				<!-- wp:paragraph -->
				<p>You've built your masterpiece, but it's still missing! Play it and share it with the world so they can give you their feedback.</p>
				<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

				<!-- wp:paragraph -->
				<p>Who knows if your game will be the next Minecraft or Fornite ðŸ™‚</p>
				<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

				<!-- wp:paragraph -->
				<p><strong>Materials &amp; requirements</strong></p>
				<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

				<!-- wp:list -->
				<ul><li>All the tools we will use are free-software license.</li><li>It is necessary that each student has access to a computer.</li><li>No previous knowledge of programming is required, we adapt to the level of each student.</li><li>6 to 12 students per group.</li><li>The classes are completely practical and are designed for students between 12 and 17 years old.</li></ul>
